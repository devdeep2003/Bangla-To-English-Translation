# Bangla-to-English Speech Translation Program

This program is specifically designed to translate spoken Bangla into English using a series of sophisticated modules. The application processes spoken language in real-time, converting Bangla speech into English text and then back into spoken English. It is built to facilitate communication and understanding using the following modules:

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken Bangla into text.
2. **Text-to-Text Translation**: Translates the Bangla text into English.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the English translated text back into speech.

## Libraries Used

The program relies on the following libraries to provide its functionality:

- **speech_recognition**: Handles the conversion of spoken language into text.
- **googletrans API**: Manages the translation of text from Bangla to English.
- **Google-text-to-speech-API**: Converts the translated English text back into audible speech.
- **pydub**: Aids in the manipulation of audio data.

## Installation

To install the required libraries for this program, you can use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition googletrans gTTS pydub
```

## Usage

To utilize this translator effectively, ensure you have a functional microphone and speakers. The program operates as follows:

1. Launch the main script.
2. Speak in Bangla into your microphone.
3. The program will capture your speech, translate it to English, and articulate the translation aloud.

### Configuration

The default settings are configured for Bangla to English translation. Adjustments can be made in the script if translation to other languages is necessary, according to the capabilities provided by the googletrans API.

## Limitations

- The program's performance in terms of speech recognition and translation accuracy may vary due to background noise, speech clarity, and accent variations.
- Dependence on internet connectivity means that any network disruptions can impact the functionality of the speech recognition and translation services.
